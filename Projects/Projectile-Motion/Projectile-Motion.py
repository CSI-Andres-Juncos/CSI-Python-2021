gravity_Ms=9.81

#Here im calculating the time by plugging in the formula with the variables defined on top. But first, you need to import the function of the square root.
import math
time_s=math.sqrt((2 * BuildingHeight_m) / gravity_Ms)

#Now that time is calculated, the variable is plugged into another formula to calculate distance, or delta x (Î”x). 
Distance_m=(Velocity_Ms * time_s)

print(f"In this first part of the experiment, the distance of the projectile fired from a {Gun} was calculated. The caliber of the gun was {Caliber} and the projectile fired is a {Ammunition} with a speed of {Velocity_Ms}m/s. The building chosen for this experiment was the {Building} with a height of {BuildingHeight_m} meters. By using the formula for time, the time was {time_s} seconds. Then the time was plugged into another formula to calculate the distance, which was {Distance_m} meters")
